abstract: "To estimate public adherence to social distancing guidelines during the Coronavirus outbreak, we analyzed departures from “typical” traffic volumes on the metro freeway system of the Twin Cities region. A robust modeling approach, open-source code repository, and web-based dashboard for interacting with the data are assisting decision makers in Minnesota as they update social distancing guidelines and monitor economic recovery."
