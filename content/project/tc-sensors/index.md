An R package for pulling data for Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) loop detectors installed on the Minnesota Freeway system in 30-second interval measurements of occupancy and volume, data which are pushed daily to a public JSON feed. 

`{tc.sensors}` is managed via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), ensuring functionality on multiple operating systems and neatly evaluating new features.
