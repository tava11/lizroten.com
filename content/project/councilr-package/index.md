`{councilR}` is the Metropolitan Council's custom R package. Features include corporate color codes, `{ggplot2}` themes, functions for accessing local and remote GIS data, and a set of RStudio snippets. The package is open-source and used by myself and my colleagues daily.    

`{councilR}` is managed via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), ensuring functionality on multiple operating systems and neatly evaluating new features.
