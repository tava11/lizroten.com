Prior to 2019, regional parks use estimates were completed using a series of Excel workbooks, originally written in the 1990s. A colleague re-wrote the procedure in a single RMarkdown document for the 2018 estimates. Later, I developed `{use.estimates}`, which spread the calculation process over multiple vignettes. Each vignette produces a report for each step in the process, which allowed our parks researcher to review results quickly. All package data is also documented for future data scientists.  

This package is managed via GitHub such that new Issues and pull requests are integrated into project management. The package is regularly tested using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
